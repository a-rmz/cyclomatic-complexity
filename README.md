# Cyclomatic complexity analizer

### How to run?
You really can't... the `app` is meant to be used only in the tests.

### How to test, then?
Install the dependencies

```$ npm install```

Run the tests

```$ npm test```

Check for the cyclomatic complexity in the `results` file.

### What does this program do?
Nothin, nothing really. It's just a demo to try out cyclomatic complexity stuff.
